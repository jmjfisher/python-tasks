Task 1:
a)
ECHO OFF
REM first will set C:\work\data\ as the working directory
cd C:\work\data\
REM then will actually copy all .txt files from that to the
REM newly created "destination" folder within "work"
xcopy *.txt C:\work\destination\

b)
ECHO OFF
REM since directory is already set from a) only need one
REM short line to accomplish this using xcopy with " . " to
REM capture all files after said date, follwed by the path of
REM the new folder
xcopy /d:1-1-2009 . C:\work\destination\

Task 2:
a)
ECHO OFF
REM first starting with an "if exist" statement, followed by
REM the file name (readme.txt) then followed by the command
REM which displays the text following the echo command
IF EXIST Readme.txt ECHO Readme.txt is in C:\work\data

b)
ECHO OFF
REM this checks to see if the file exists, if that's true
REM it'll rename (REN) it by referencing the file that needs
REM to be renamed, followed by the file's new name
IF EXIST readme.txt REN readme.txt readme_new.txt

Task 3:
a)
ECHO OFF
REM first, change the directory
REM the user has to call this batch, followed by the name of the
REM shapefile they wish to check which will be stored in "%1"
REM that string is added to .shp to see if it exists
REM if true, then that parameter with the .shp extension is
REM printed out with more text explaining it exists
cd C:\work\data\
IF EXIST %1.shp ECHO %1.shp is in the current directory

b)
ECHO OFF
REM first, change the directory
REM then, a variable "n" is set to the value 0
REM this batch will be called with a parameter which will be
REM stored as %1 which will go through the four "if" statements
REM and if any of those are true, "n" will have 1 added to it
REM by the end, n will be 0,1,2,3, or 4 and that value will
REM be displayed via echo with some text explaining there are that
REM many %1 files in the directory
cd C:\work\data\
set n=0
IF EXIST %1.shp set /a n+=1
IF EXIST %1.shx set /a n+=1
IF EXIST %1.dbf set /a n+=1
IF EXIST %1.prj set /a n+=1
ECHO %n% files were found in current directory

c)
ECHO OFF
REM first, change the directory, the parameter called with
REM this batch will be stored as %1
REM it will then flow through the following "if" statements in order
REM if the first is true, it means %1 is a full shapefile including
REM a projection, if the second is true, then %1 is still a full
REM shapefile, but without a projection file.
REM the next if/else/if/else statment makes sure that if any of
REM .shp , .shx , .dbf are missing, only one line will be echoed
REM explaining that %1 is not a complete shapefile
cd C:\work\data\
IF EXIST %1.dbf IF EXIST %1.shp IF EXIST %1.shx IF EXIST %1.prj ECHO %1 is a complete shapefile including projection
IF EXIST %1.dbf IF EXIST %1.shp IF EXIST %1.shx IF NOT EXIST %1.prj ECHO %1 is a complete shapefile but not including projection
IF NOT EXIST %1.dbf (
    ECHO %1 is not a complete shapefile
) ELSE (
    IF NOT EXIST %1.shp (
        ECHO %1 is not a complete shapefile
    ) ELSE (
        IF NOT EXIST %1.shx ECHO %1 is not a complete shapefile
    )
)

Task 4:
echo file info > result.txt
REM creates a new file “result.txt” and will have the text “file info” REM written in it. If result.txt was already a file, that will be
REM overwritten

dir \soils\daneSoils\ > daneData.txt
REM this will produce the prompt to display "The system cannot
REM find the path specified" because there is no *:\ before \soils...
REM apparently the command does not assume that this is a continuation
REM of the directory in which it is already

find /i "Robinson" < daneData.txt >> result.txt
REM this will search the “daneData.txt” file for all instances of
REM “Robinson” regardless of the case of its characters (ROBINSON,
REM robinson, or ROBinsON will all be included). Then, all lines
REM containing “robinson” will be appended as a list to the end of the REM existing “result.txt” file. If “result.txt” does not already
REM exist, it will be created with the lines including “robinson”
REM output as its text.

type result.txt | find “he”
REM all of the text within “result.txt” will be searched for the
REM string “he” and the output (within the command prompt window) will REM be all of the lines in “result.txt” that contain “he”
