GDAL Tasks
a)
REM the following code outputs all of the necessary information to determine
REM the real-world ground dimentions for corona.tif
cd C:\work\data\
gdalinfo corona.tif
REM from that we get "UNIT["metre",1," so the unit is meters and 
REM Pixel Size = (5.000000000000000,-5.000000000000000) which means each
REM pixel represents 5 units, or 5 meters
REM since the image is 1792x1434 pixes from the line "Size is 1792, 1434"
REM the actual ground area this represents is 8960m x 7170m
REM or 64,243,200 square meters

b)
REM At 100 pixels/cm, the printed size would be 17.92cm x 14.34cm
REM per question a), the real life width takes up 8960m or 896000cm
REM if we calculate 896000/17.92 we get 50,000 and therefore the
REM scale is 1:50,000 which is to say that if we multiplied the length
REM or width of the picture by 50,000, it would then be the same
REM size that the image takes up in real life (earth's surface)

c) and d)
cd C:\work\data\
REM the following command will take all of the supported information and
REM write it to the ouput.txt file. I know the instructions recommend
REM that a pipe command is used, but per Yuying's instructions in the
REM discussion, that isn't necessary since we don't need to drill down
REM as printing all of the information is fine, so only > is used.
REM In that file one can see that the 4th line describes the coordinate
REM reference system: "Coordinate System is:..." UTM zone 10 NAD27
gdalinfo independence.dem > output.txt
REM the following part will perform the reprojection, second bullet
REM from the output of the first section we learned that this DEM
REM was in UTM zone 10, west cost of NA, so we first need to warp
REM or reproject it to the desired datum of NAD83
REM the gdalwarp command with the t_srs sets the target srs and the
REM following information in quotes is all of the desired settings
REM based on spatialreference.org Proj4 settings for EPSG:26910
REM the output will be a geotiff which is why we then need to translate
REM the tiff to the USGSDEM file which we desired
REM this is done with the last line which has an ouput format of USGSDEM
REM and the input is the tif while the output is the same name but a dem file
gdalwarp -t_srs “+proj=utm +zone=10 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs” independence.dem independence-NAD83.tif
gdal_translate -of USGSDEM independence-NAD83.tif independence-NAD83.dem

e)
REM this scripts calls gdaldem hillshade which generates a shaded
REM relief map from an elevation raster and -z X sets the vertical
REM exaggeration factor to X, which in this script will be 2.
REM that is followed by the input dem and the output's name
cd C:\work\data\
gdaldem hillshade -z 2 independence-NAD83.dem independence83shade2.tif

f)
REM gdal_contour is the command used to create a contour map from a dem file
REM the -i X sets the elevation change interval which for this is 10
REM then the -a string is what the elevation attribute will be named in the table
REM which I decided to call height, this helps so I can check my work by looking
REM at the attribute table in arcmap after the file is created.
REM That is followed by the input file then followed by the output shapefile's name
cd C:\work\data\
gdal_contour -i 10.0 -a height independence-NAD83.dem independence-NAD83contour

OGR Tasks
a)
REM the real world dimensions of said shp are 34,316.52 ft x 35,921.47 ft
REM and the command I used to arrive at that answer is as follows:
cd C:\work\data\
ogrinfo -so bldg_clip_dist.shp bldg_clip_dist
REM from that output, which gives us the summary of the bldg_clip_dist layer
REM of the bldg_clip_dist.shp we can see the EXTENT field which is in the format of
REM (xmin, ymin) - (xmax, ymax). From that I can take the difference of the x and y
REM values to arrive at the length and width of the layer. Then we see that the
REM UNIT is written as "Foot_US" so we also know the measurment units.
REM The place on earth that is covered by this image can NOT be determined
REM from those dimensions because they are not location specific - one could
REM measure many 34k ft x 35k ft rectangles on the earth's surface.
REM That being said, there IS enough information in the ogrinfo -so
REM output to piece together the shapefile's location on the earth's surface
REM but I am understanding the question to ask if it is possible ONLY
REM "from these dimesions" which is referencing the "bounding rectangle"
REM which as I said before is a measurment, not a location.

b)
REM there are 41 different land use categories in the lulc_clip_dist shapefile
REM to arrive at that answer I used the sql abilities within ogrinfo
REM my sql displys the count of distict lu values from the lulc_clip_dist layer
REM from the lulc_clip_dist.shp. Within that output at the very end it reads
REM COUNT_lu (Integer) = 41 and therefore there are 41 distinct lu categories
cd C:\work\data\
ogrinfo -sql "select count(distinct lu) from lulc_clip_dist" lulc_clip_dist.shp

c)
REM the following is the .bat called shp2kml which calls for a single string parameter
REM it will then search the directory for all %1.shp files and convert them to
REM kml files which are read with google earth
shp2kml.bat %1
cd C:\work\data\
ogr2ogr -f "KML" %1.kml %1.shp
